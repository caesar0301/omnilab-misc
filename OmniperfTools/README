Utilities to process Omniperf/ARO logs
------------------

* Trace inspection

|-- packetBurst.py: inspect data trend of packet burst of trace
|-- flowBurst.py: inspect data trend of flow burst of trace
|-- flow_burst_single.py: backend of flowBurst.py; it swallow a pcap file
|-- userClicks.py: inspect user touching screen of trace


* Model preparation

|-- exHttp.py: extract Http logs from pcap file of trace
`-- webtree.py: data structure used by models
   |-- exWebTree.py: inspect the relationship of entities
   `-- user.py: inspect user activities from HTTP logs


* AEM model implementation and evaluation:

|-- aem.py: implementation of AEM model
   `-- runAEM.py: example of running AEM model
|-- groundtruth.py: implementation of groundtruth based on user click data.
|-- perf_aem.py: evaluate AEM performance against GT
|-- perf_streamstructure.py: evaluate StreamStructure alg. against GT


* Batch scripts:

|-- *.sh: run jobs in a batch mode
