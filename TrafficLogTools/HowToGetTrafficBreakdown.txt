* trafficStatRawDpiLog.py

This script obtains the statistics about traffic on link on protocal map.
Each line in the output file gives traffic breakdown about each protocal
with PROTOCAL NAME, FLOW COUNT, PACKET COUNT, BYTES COUNT.


* trafficStatRawTstatLog.py

This script obtains the statistics about TCP and UDP traffic from Tstat output.
The TCP statistics contains both complete and incomplete flows, which is stored in
"log_tcp_complete" and "log_tcp_nocomplete" respectively.
Each line in the output gives the traffic breakdown during a hour;
from the second ahead, the first five values give FLOW COUNT, UL PACKETS, DL PACKETS,
UL BYTES and DL BYTES about TCP, and the left gives those about UDP.

NOTE:The BYTES values present only the payload volume without header consumpution 
carried by TCP and UDP. 
And the directions of upload and download are determined by the "IP_REGEX" parameter
that gives the source IP pattern in the script.
